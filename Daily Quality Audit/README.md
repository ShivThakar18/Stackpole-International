#Daily Quality Audits
This project was used to digitize the procedure of conducting Daily Shift Reports. 

##Entry Dashboard
The Daily Quality Audit.JSON file is the first part of the program. This was a designed NodeRed Flow that allowed the user to input different aspects of their audit such as Specific Requests, Critical Calls, and Machines in Bypass. The dashboard uses many UI and Function nodes to create a user-friendly interface. This program also has SQL Integration that feeds all the entries in the audit to a SQL Server and can be viewed in Grafana 8.1.

##Grafana Dashboard - Main Developer (Principal Engineer @ Stackpole Ancaster - Jack C. Fung)
This dashboard was created by Principal Engineer at Stackpole Ancaster. I was new to SQL at the time so I only helped to add some of the panels such as the pie charts.
