# Stackpole-International
This repository contains all the programming-related projects I worked on during my co-op term at Stackpole International. 

## Audit Follow Up Program


## Enterprise Report Scheduler - Stackpole Quality Terminal 
This project was designed to allow the Quality Manager and Quality Engineers to navigate ERS Reports more efficiently. This Python program uses the TKinter Python library to create a user interface where QEs can review the history of the ERS Scheduler. The main purpose is to be able to easily search for specific parts and view their Cpk Reports, Raw Data Export, and Histogram (if applicable).

## CMM Programs
- Clutch Hub Copier
- Duramax Excel Exports
- Gear From Printer
- Gleason

### Clutch Hub Copier

### Duramax Excel Exports

### Gear Form Printer

### Gleason
This project was designed to run alongside the Gleason CMM Machine at Stackpole PMDA. A program on Gleason creates a CSV file that will be modified using this Python script. The Python script reads the latest CSV file and extracts specific rows and writes them into a new Excel file. The Excel file is formatted and printed using the default Windows printer. The program on the Gleason computer automatically archives this CSV once the Excel file is printed. 

## Sediment Tests
