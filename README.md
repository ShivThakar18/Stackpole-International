# Stackpole-International
This repository contains all the programming-related projects I worked on during my co-op term at Stackpole International. 

## Gleason
This project was designed tp run along side the Gleason CMM Machine at Stackpole PMDA. A program on Gleason creates a csv file that will be modified using this python script. The python script reads the latest csv file and extracts specific rows and writes them into a new excel file. The excel file is formatted and printed using the default Windows printer. The program on the Gleason computer automatically archives this csv once the excel file is printed.
