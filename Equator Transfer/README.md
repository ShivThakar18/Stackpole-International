# Equator Transfer Program
This program was developed to gather several data files from different network drives to a central folder. 

At Stackpole we used 3 Renishaw Equator Gauges to conduct measurments and inspections for Clutch Hubs. Each Equator Gauges shares SPC Data on a network drive that another PC has access.
